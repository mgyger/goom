To build the code you will need the ARM cross-compiler and tools: under
Debian, packages gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi and binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi.

The Python program ctrl.py provides a simple user interface for adjusting
the parameters of the patches on MIDI channels 2 to 16. (The patch on
MIDI channel 1 is always controlled from Goom's front panel.) You will
need the Python portmidi library and the Python Gtk developer library:
under Debian, packages python-pypm and python-gtk2. Run the program from
the command line.
